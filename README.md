Required Features
 App displays a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe board.
 Players can take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board.
 App determines and displays the winner once a player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
 Users can reset the game to start a new match.

Additional Features
 A player score tracker to keep track of wins for each player.
 Ambient colors and stylish fonts for an enhanced visual experience.
 Sound effects for moves and win notifications.
 A simple and intuitive user interface designed with SwiftUI.
 The game board dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.

üìù Notes
During development, one of the main challenges was implementing the persistent state management to ensure the game state is saved when the app is closed. I was able to overcome this and implement a seamless user experience.
